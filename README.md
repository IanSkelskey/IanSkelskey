### Hello, I'm Ian Skelskey üëã

I'm a software engineer based in Connecticut. I have recently accepted a position at Bibliomation Inc. as an Evergreen Systems Specialist. My role involves maintaining a system built upon the open-source app [Evergreen](https://github.com/evergreen-library-system/Evergreen). With a B.S. in Software Engineering from Arizona State University and an A.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics from CT State Tunxis, I combine technical proficiency with creative flair in all my projects.

### üéØ Current Focus

- Maintaining and improving the Evergreen library system.
- Revisitng my artistic roots and updating my DeviantArt account, [IanSkelskey](https://www.deviantart.com/ianskelskey), after 10 years.
- Developing [ai_diff_commit](https://github.com/IanSkelskey/ai-diff-commit), a tool that uses AI and the conventional commit standard to automate my commit message writing.
- Actively seeking new opportunities where creativity and innovation are valued.
