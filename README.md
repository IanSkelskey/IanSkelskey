# Hello, I'm Ian Skelskey üëã

I'm a software engineer based in Connecticut. I currently work as an Evergreen Systems Specialist at Bibliomation Inc., where I manage and contribute to the open-source Evergreen ILS, a robust library system serving Connecticut's largest library consortium. With a B.S. in Software Engineering from Arizona State University and an A.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics from CT State Tunxis, I combine technical expertise with a passion for creative problem-solving and continuous learning.

## üéØ Current Focus

- Maintaining and improving the Evergreen Integrated Library System (ILS).
  - I now have code and documentation included in four minor releases: [3.11](https://evergreen-ils.org/documentation/release/RELEASE_NOTES_3_11.html), [3.12](https://evergreen-ils.org/documentation/release/RELEASE_NOTES_3_12.html), [3.13](https://evergreen-ils.org/documentation/release/RELEASE_NOTES_3_13.html), and [3.14](https://evergreen-ils.org/documentation/release/RELEASE_NOTES_3_14.html).
- Developing [evergit](https://github.com/IanSkelskey/evergit), a globally deployable npm tool for automating commit messages in Evergreen repositories. Easily install it using `npm install -g evergit` and run it in any Git repository.
- Reconnecting with my artistic roots and updating my DeviantArt account, [IanSkelskey](https://www.deviantart.com/ianskelskey), after a decade.
